# Coordination Training Evaluation App for ICAROS Pro

Abstract: Technological advances continually reduce the effort to digitally transform health-related
activities such as rehabilitation and training. Exemplary systems use tracking and vital sign
monitoring to assess physical condition and training progress. This paper presents a system for
body stability training and coordination evaluation, using cost-efficient tracking and monitoring
solutions. It implements the use case of app-guided back posture tracking on the ICAROS Pro
training device via SteamVR Tracking 2.0, with pulse and respiration rate monitoring via Zephyr
BioHarness 3.0. A longitudinal study on training effects with 20 subjects was conducted, involving
a representative procedure created with a sports manager. Posture errors served as main progress
indicator, pulse and respiration rates as co-indicators. Outcomes suggest the system’s capabilities
to foster comprehension of effects and steering of exercises. Further, a secondary study presents a
self-developed VR-based exergame demo for future system expansion. The Empatica EmbracePlus
was used as alternative for vital sign acquisition. User experiences of five subjects gathered via
a survey highlight its motivating and entertaining character. For both, a thorough discussion
elaborates potentials and current limitations. The developed training system can serve as template
and be adjusted for further use cases, and the exergame’s reception revealed prospective extension
directions. Software components are made available on submission via GitHub.
